You will be given the news claim and potentially news image, headline, and news post of it. You will then be given one fact-checking reasoning document for this news claim. 

Your task is to rate the fact-checking document on one metric. The metric is 'Fact_Hallucination'.

Please make sure you read and understand these instructions carefully. Please keep this document open while reviewing, and refer to it as needed.

**Metric Definition:** Fact_Hallucination refers to the presence of information in the fact-checking document that is not supported by evidence or is entirely fabricated. It assesses whether the document contains any incorrect or misleading information that cannot be verified by reliable sources.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
You should consider the following criteria when evaluating the fact hallucination in a fact-checking document:
1. **Presence of Unsupported Claims:**
   - Does the document include any statements or claims that are not supported by evidence?
   - Are there any assertions made without proper references or sources?

2. **Accuracy of Information:**
   - Is the information presented in the document factually correct and verifiable?
   - Are there any false or fabricated details?

3. **Verification of Sources:**
   - Are the sources cited in the document reliable and verifiable?
   - Does the document use credible sources to back its claims?

4. **Consistency with Known Facts:**
   - Does the document align with established facts and widely accepted knowledge?
   - Are there any deviations from verified information?

**Evaluation Steps:**

1. **Identify Key Points:**
   - Analyze the news claim and identify the main points and arguments presented in the fact-checking document.

2. **Assess Unsupported Claims:**
   - Evaluate if the document includes any statements or claims that lack supporting evidence.

3. **Check Information Accuracy:**
   - Verify the factual correctness and verifiability of the information presented in the document.

4. **Analyze Source Reliability:**
   - Assess the reliability and credibility of the sources cited in the document.

5. **Ensure Consistency with Known Facts:**
   - Check if the document aligns with established facts and widely accepted knowledge.

6. **Assign a Score:**
   - Based on the above analysis, assign a score from 0 to 5:
       - **1:** High hallucination. The document contains numerous unsupported claims and fabricated information.
       - **2:** Significant hallucination. The document includes some unsupported or incorrect claims, with several factual inaccuracies.
       - **3:** Moderate hallucination. The document is generally accurate but contains a few unsupported or incorrect claims.
       - **4:** Low hallucination. The document is mostly accurate with minor issues, and most claims are well-supported by evidence.
       - **5:** No hallucination. The document is completely accurate, with all claims well-supported by reliable evidence.

**Additional Notes:**
* The fact hallucination score should focus on the presence of unsupported or fabricated information rather than the depth or comprehensiveness of the analysis.
* The LLM should not penalize the document for minor mistakes if the overall information is accurate and well-supported by evidence.
